        <h3>Controversial Adipurush dialogues altered after public pressure, ‘jalegi tere baap ki’ changed to ‘jalegi bhi teri Lanka’</h3>

        Days after its debut, the objectionable dialogues in the film Adipurush have been altered. The new version of the movie is now being screened in theatres, as per sources. A section of the film’s core audience objected to certain lines of dialogue in the film, based on the Hindu epic Ramayana. It was suggested that some lines, penned by lyricist-writer Manoj Muntashir, had a pedestrian quality that didn’t respect the sanctity of the source material.

The Central Board of Film Certification, which had previously given Adipurush a U certificate, approved of the changes on June 19, according to a report on Filminformation.com. The official CBFC website also lists Adipurush as having been re-certified on June 19, after being initially cleared on June 12. The film was released on June 16. Here’s a list of the original lines, and the new versions:

<br />1. Tu andar kaise ghusa… tu jaanta bhi hai kaun hoon main, has been replaced by, Tum andar kaise ghuse… tum jaante bhi ho kaun hoon main.
<br />2. Kapda tere baap ka… toh jalegi bhi tere baap ki, has been modified to, Kapda teri Lanka ka… toh jalegi bhi teri Lanka.

<br />3. Jo hamari behno… unki Lanka laga denge, has been replaced by, Jo hamari behno… unki Lanka mein aag laga denge.

<br />4. Mere ek sapole ne tumhare iss sheshnaag ko lamba kar diya… bhara pada hai, has been changed to, Mere ek sapole ne tumhare iss sheshnaag ko samapt kar diya… bhara pada hai.<br />
Backlash against the dialogues was observed on the first day of release itself, with many critics and audience members noting their jarring quality. A day after release, Muntashir was asked about this in an interview with the Republic, and he claimed to have grown up listening to versions of the Ramayana told in colloquial language. A day after that, he told Aaj Tak that Adipurush isn’t an adaptation of the Ramayana after all, but is ‘inspired’ by it. Later that same day, he announced that the objectionable lines will be altered to honour audience sentiment.
Earlier this week, Muntashir said that the studio’s decision to change these lines is ‘brave’, and they did it despite knowing what a ‘logistical nightmare’ it would present. Adipurush is directed by Om Raut, who said in the Republic interview that he is more concerned about audience response than reviews. But there seem to be few takers for the movie, which has experienced historical drops at the box office after delivering big numbers over the opening weekend. After five days, the film’s worldwide gross collection stands at Rs 395 crore. It was reportedly produced on a budget of at least Rs 500 crore.
